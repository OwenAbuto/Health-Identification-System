## Health-Identification-System
Software Development Project. 

This is a simple health identification system implemented in Python, designed to help healthcare professionals manage patient records and identify patients efficiently, for a Software Development Course.

## Features/Characteristics

- **Patient Registration:** Medical services experts and non experts can enroll new patients and store their data safely.

- **Patient Search:** Effectively search and distinguish patients in view of their name, date of birth, or different rules.

- **Patient Profiles:** View point by point patient profiles, including clinical history, current prescriptions, and sensitivities.

- **Client Authentication:** Secure client validation for medical services experts.

- **Security:** Patient information is put away safely with legitimate encryption and access controls.

- **Information Reinforcement and Recovery:** Normal information reinforcement and recuperation techniques to forestall information misfortune.

- ### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
